HippUnfold Data of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initative (ADNI)
---
### This is an R project dedicated towards the collection of volume and surface metrics of the hippocampus in a longitudinal study of ADNI cohorts, with the goal to establish whether late-life depression aggregates hippocampus morpohometry with the recently developed HippUnfold computational modeler.

---

Currently, this project is limited to the first phase of ADNI, which is comprised of 3.0T T1w scans (most typically MPRAGE or SAG3DMPRAGE) across five years. 

MRI data collected in this project is also limited to on-site assessment of the 15-point Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at the same visit.

HippUnfold version 1.2.0 <cite> <description> and Freesurfer <version> <cite> was executed on CBRAIN <cite>.
